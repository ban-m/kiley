## Overview

![GHAPassing](https://github.com/ban-m/kiley/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)


In this crate, I implement

- (Banded-)Ternary alignment with edit distance ,
- (Banded-)Bialignment with edit distance,
- (Banded-)pair hidden Markov model with forward/backward/viterbi algorithm, and
- (Banded-)generalized pair hidden Markov model with forward/backward/viterbi/pseudo-Baum-Whelch algorithm 

In addition, there is a function to estimate the maximum-likelihood sequence based on a pair hidden Markov model.
